# conll-rdf
__conll-rdf__ is a tool package for converting between formats of annotated linguistic corpora and linking to external ontologies.  
It consists of a number of java modules which can be chained to construct a data processing pipeline.  
A variety of CoNLL formats are supported.

## What it can do
* convert any CoNLL-like tsv format (e.g. `.conll`) to conll-rdf (`.ttl`).
* perform SPARQL Updates on conll-rdf data.
* visualize conll-rdf structure.
* convert conll-rdf back to conll.

## How it works
In general, we read data line by line from `stdin`, process it and write results to `stdout`.  
For quick set-up, we recommend using `.sh` scripts to pipe your data through the tools.  
Each pipeline element can be called via `./run.sh $CLASS [args]`.  

Another method is to configure the pipeline in a config-json and call the entire pipeline with `./run.sh CoNLLRDFManager -c $config-json`.

Of course you can also use the provided classes within java as any other library.

## Installing
Download the repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/acoli-repo/CoNLL-RDF.git`.

The source is compiled automatically once you run the tool via the `run.sh` bash script.

### Requirements
* JDK (now part of Java SE) or OpenJDK, version 8 or higher.
  * run `java -version` to check if java is installed.
  * run `javac -version` to check if your version of the compiler is sufficient.
* Maven 3.3+ (Optional but recommended).
  * run `mvn -version` to check if Maven is installed.

Note: If you prefer using OpenJDK instead of Oracle Java, it might be necessary to install openjfx. `sudo apt-get install openjfx` (Thanks to Francesco Mambrini for finding out!)  

All required java libraries are contained in [lib/](./lib).

## Common Issues
* **if your pipelines broke with an update** in 2020-09 or soon after, you're likely calling the classes directly with `java`and not via `./run.sh`. You can change your scripts to call `./run.sh` (or copy the changes we made to `run.sh` into your scripts).
* you might get an error like `bash: ./../test.sh: Permission denied` when trying to run a script. Use this command to change the filemode: `chmod +x <SCRIPT>`
* an error starting like `ERROR CoNLLRDFUpdater :: SPARQL parse exception for Update No. 0: DIRECTUPDATE [...]` when running the RDFUpdater can be raised if the path to a sparql query is wrong. Check for extra or missing `../`.

## Getting Started
All relevant classes are in [src/](./src/org/acoli/conll/rdf). Documentation for them is found in [doc/](doc/).

A [hands-on tutorial](./examples/README.md) with a variety of sample-pipelines, which you can adapt to your needs, can be found in [examples/](./examples). These convert data found in [data/](./data/ud/UD_English-master).

In case your corpus directly corresponds to a format found there you can directly convert it with given scripts into conll-rdf.

### Example
Suppose we have a corpus `example.conll` and want to convert it to conll-rdf to make it compatible with a given LLOD technology. We can do this with a simple shell-command:

```shell
cat example.conll | ./run.sh CoNLLStreamExtractor my-baseuri.org/example.conll# \
    ID WORD LEMMA POS_COARSE POS FEATS HEAD EDGE > example.ttl
```

This will create a new file `example.ttl` in conll-rdf by simply providing

* a base-URI (ideally a resolvable URL to adhere to the five stars of LOD).
* the names of the CoNLL columns from left to right.

### run.sh
`run.sh` is used to make things feel more bash-like. It determines the classpath, updates class files if necessary and runs the specified java class with the provided arguments.
* eg. `cat foo.ttl | ./run.sh CoNLLRDFFormatter > foo_formatted.ttl` would pipe `foo.ttl` through `CoNLLRDFFormatter` into `foo_formatted.ttl`.
* In case the respective `.class` files cannot be found, `run.sh` calls `compile.sh` to compile the java classes from source. Of course, you may also run `compile.sh` independently.

## Features
In-depth information on all the classes of **conll-rdf** can be found in [the documentation.](doc/classes.md)

IMPORTANT USAGE HINT: All given data is parsed sentence-wise (if applicable). Meaning that for CoNLL data as input a newline is considered as a sentence boundary marker (in regard to the CoNLL data model). The ID column (if present) must contain sentence internal IDs (if this is not the case this column must be renamed before conversion/parsing) - if no such column is provided sentence internal IDs will be generated. Please refer to the paper mentioned below under Reference.

### CoNLLRDFManager
`CoNLLRDFManager` processes a pipeline provided as JSON.  
Synopsis: `CoNLLRDFManager -c [JSON-config]`

### CoNLLStreamExtractor
`CoNLLStreamExtractor` expects CoNLL from `stdin` and writes conll-rdf to `stdout`.  
Synopsis: `CoNLLStreamExtractor baseURI FIELD1[.. FIELDn] [-s SPARQL_SELECT]`

### CoNLLRDFUpdater
`CoNLLRDFUpdater` expects conll-rdf from `stdin` and writes conll-rdf to `stdout`. It is designed for updating existing conll-rdf files and is able to load external ontologies or RDF data into separate Graphs during runtime. This is especially useful for linking CoNLL-RDF files to other ontologies.  
It can also output `.dot` graph-files (or triples `stdout`).  
Synopsis: `CoNLLRDFUpdater -custom [-model URI [GRAPH]] [-updates [UPDATE]]`

### CoNLLRDFFormatter
`CoNLLRDFFormatter` expects conll-rdf in `.ttl` and writes to different formats. Can also visualize your data.  
Synopsis: ```CoNLLRDFFormatter [-rdf [COLS]] [-debug] [-grammar] [-semantics] [-conll COLS] [-sparqltsv SPARQL]```

It can write:
* canonical conll-rdf as `.ttl`.
* `.conll` of specified columns.
* TSV to `stdout` based on a given sparql select query.
* `debug` highlighted `.ttl` to `stderr`, e.g. highlighting triples representing conll columns or sentence structure differently.
> ![-debug](doc/img/conllrdfformatter-debug.png)  
> Example from universal dependencies.
* `grammar`: writes conll data structure in tree-like format to `stdout`. (`/` resp. `\` are pointing in direction of `conll:HEAD`)
> ![-grammar](doc/img/conllrdfformatter-grammar.png)  
> Example from universal dependencies.
* `semantics` seperate visualization of object properties of `conll:WORD` using `terms:` namespace, useful for visualizing knowledge graphs. **`EXPERIMENTAL`**

### CoNLLRDFAnnotator
* can be used to manually annotate / change annotations in .ttl files.
* will visualize input just like `CoNLLRDFFormatter -grammar`. Will not make in-place changes but write the changed file to `stdout` (e.g. `./run.sh CoNLLRDFAnnotator file_old.ttl > file_new.ttl`)
	* **Note**: Piping output into old file is **not** supported! Will result in data loss.

### Other
* `CoNLL2RDF` contains the central conversion functionality. For practical uses, interface with its functionality through CoNLLStreamExtractor. Arguments to CoNLLStreamExtractor will be passed through.
* `CoNLLRDFViz` is an auxiliary class for the future development of debugging and visualizing complex SPARQL Update chains in their effects on selected pieces of CoNLL(-RDF) data
* conll-rdf assumes UTF-8.
